                    About Vé
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Vé comes from the name of the Nordic God Vé who gave the ability of language to humans.
                    This project was inspired by the skills of this heavenly force, as the aim of this project
                    is to help language learners to acquire foreign languages.

                    out of which they shaped a man and a woman. The first (Odin) infused into them life and spirit; the second (Vili)
                    endowed them with reason and the power of motion; the third (Vé) gave them speech and features, hearing and vision.
