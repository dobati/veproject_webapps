                    About us
                </h2>
                <p>
                    We are three linguists interested in natural language processing and language learning.
                    We have been fascinated by languages for a long time and have learned Croatian, Danish,
                    English, French, German, Hungarian, Indonesian, Icelandic, Italian and Russian.
                    We created VÃ© to add Spanish to this list. 
                </p>

                    During the development of this language learning
                    system several open source tools were used. By making this project freely accessible we would
                    like to give a little bit back and thank the open-source community to support us in our learning process.
